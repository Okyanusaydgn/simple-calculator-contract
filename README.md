# Simple Calculator Smart Contract

## Project Idea
The goal of this project is to create a simple on-chain calculator smart contract.  
Users will be able to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
The result of each operation will be stored on-chain and can be retrieved later.

## Features
- Add two numbers
- Subtract two numbers
- Multiply two numbers
- Divide two numbers (with check for division by zero)
- Store and retrieve the latest result

## Benefits
- Demonstrates basic smart contract functionality
- Provides a simple example for mathematical operations on-chain
- Easy to extend with more functions if needed

## Future Improvements
- Support for multiple users with their own stored results
- History tracking of past calculations
- Advanced mathematical operations (square root, power, modulo)

## Repository
This repository will contain:
- `contracts/` → Smart contract code
- `README.md` → Project description and documentation
